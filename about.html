            <p>
                The increasing use of the internet, social networks, and smart devices in the past decade has led to a significant growth in behavioral and social data available for researchers. However, utilizing this data in social sciences requires the transfer of prior experiences, learning essential technical skills and knowledge, and understanding the challenges of applying data science and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the emerging nature of computational social sciences and the lack of comprehensive knowledge and specialized faculties in this field in Iran, the need to train skilled professionals to meet the country’s industrial demands is strongly felt.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mofid Data Analysis Company (Metadata)</strong>, recognizing this fundamental national need, has taken steps in this direction by leveraging the expertise of professionals from both industry and academia. The company is prepared to offer qualitative and quantitative services across all relevant fields.
